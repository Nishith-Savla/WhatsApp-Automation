 ## Feature: 
QR CODE Scanning: I have added a Cookie system that will save your session so that whatsapp don't think you are login for first time. By Saving Session data you will have to scan QR Code to Login only once for the session until you don't logout from the WhatsApp Web.

### Usage Note:
Please enter the **name of the chat as it shows up on the whatsapp web** and also be sure about case as it is case sensitive.
